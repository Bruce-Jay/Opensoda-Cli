If you want to explore an another repo, just type in `opendigger -r <author/repo_name> -m openrank` to get the information. Here `-r` indicates a repository url, `-m` indicates the metric to be used. 

**For more information of metrics, please visit** https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger#metrics-or-indices-usage. Hopefully you will be excited at the wonderful world. And I'm very appreciated of you to contribute to it!

You can also **export your result to local**, just add `-d` choice. Have a try of 
```bash
opendigger -r X-lab2017/oss101 -m activity -d
```
![](/public/cut1.gif)

the result will be stored at `.output/[author/repo_name].md`

What's more, you can specify a time to search one metric at specific time. This command 
```bash
opendigger -r X-lab2017/oss101 -t 2023-07 -m activity -d
```
will return the `activity` metric of repository `X-lab2017/oss101` in `2023-07`.

Searching all of the metrics at a specific time is supported, just without specifying metric argument. Try command
```bash
opendigger -r X-lab2017/oss101 -t 2023-04 -d
```
the result will be very exciting!

Searching all metrics without specifying time is not supported now, because the output is too large and hard to read.




More features are coming soon~
