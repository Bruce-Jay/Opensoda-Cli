Support searching for many metrics.

Type in `opendigger -r [author/repo_name] -m [metric]` to explore the metrics of a repo! To specify a time, you can also add a -t argument. For example, type in `opendigger -r X-lab2017/oss101 -t 2023-04 -m activity -d` to have a try!

You can also type in `opendigger -r [author/repo_name] -t [time]` to see all metrics in one period. But you can't get result with only `opendigger -r [author/repo_name]` now, because the data is too much.

More features coming soon~
